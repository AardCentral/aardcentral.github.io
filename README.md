I started this project quite a while ago to create a centralized location where players can find plugins specifically for Aardwolf. The ones on the page are the ones that I'm aware of, though there may be more plugin writers than what is displayed there.

I attempt to keep the people of Aardwolf safe by not promoting illegal plugins, or plugins that may potentially get a player banned or nuked. If your name is not up here, but it was previously, it's because you have a repository that could do damage to a player who doesn't know better.
